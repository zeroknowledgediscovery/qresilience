# q-resilience

We estimate the resilience of US society using lareg scale surveys, such as the GSS over time. We use the **quasinet** tool to infer digital twins of the surveys, and then estimate how fast each model recovers from perturbations. This rate of recovery, quantified as the physical time-constant of the dynamics, gioves us a quantitative estimate of resilience.
